#include <iostream>

/* There are many types of operations that can be performed in C++. 
    We went over boolean operations in Lab 4, but there are more types like arithmetic operations.
    Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

    Common Arithmetic Operators:
    + : Addition
    - : Subtraction
    * : Multiplication
    / : Division
    % : Modulus (remainder of division)
    ++ : Increment (add 1)
    -- : Decrement (subtract 1)
    += : Add and assign
    -= : Subtract and assign
    *= : Multiply and assign
    /= : Divide and assign
    %= : Modulus and assign

    Examples:
    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;
    int sum = a + b;        // sum is 13
    int difference = a - b; // difference is 7
    int product = a * b;    // product is 30
    int quotient = a / b;   // quotient is 3 (integer division)
    int remainder = a % b;  // remainder is 1
    a++;                    // a is now 11
    b--;                    // b is now 2
    a += b;                 // a is now 13
    a -= b;                 // a is now 10
    a *= b;                 // a is now 20
    a /= b;                 // a is now 10
    a %= b;                 // a is now 1

int main() {
    // We can print the results of arithmetic operations directly
    std::cout << "5 + 3 = " << (5 + 3) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "10 - 4 = " << (10 - 4) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "6 * 7 = " << (6 * 7) << std::endl;

    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;

    // Lab 6: 

    // 1. Create and print the results of the following operations

    // a. 4 + 5

    
    // b. a - 7


    // c. b * 8

    // 2. Perform the following operations on the variable 'number' and print the results after each operation

    // a. Increment number by 1 (use the ++ operator)

    // b. Multiply number by 3

    // c. Subtract 4 from number

    // d. Set the value of number to the remainder of number divided by 3
