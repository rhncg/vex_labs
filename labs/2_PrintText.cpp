/* Text can be printed to the console using the std::cout object. 
    To print some text, use the following format:
    std::cout << "<text>" << std::endl;

    Example:
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;

    Don't worry too much about what the :: in std::cout does and what << does, we may cover that later
